00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.920
Rubisco is important, and that's why it's
2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.163
the most plentiful protein on earth.
3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.420
But, just because you're important,
4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.303
doesn't mean you're entirely competent.
5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.290
It's, in this case, not the best enzyme in the world.
6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.630
It's got a hard job, so it's doing its best,
7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.810
but at the same time it exists in an atmosphere
8
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.970
that's not predominantly carbon dioxide,
9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.280
it's mostly oxygen.
10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.570
And about one in every four or five reactions
11
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.793
it grabs oxygen instead of carbon dioxide.
12
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.619
That's right. RuBisCO screws up
13
00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:36.990
about a fifth of the time.
14
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.490
Instead of attaching a carbon dioxide,
15
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.200
it attaches an oxygen molecule.
16
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.121
And that's trouble.
17
00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:43.954
(alarm beeping)
18
00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:45.620
You're saying nature has created
19
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.620
a screwed-up little worker enzyme?
20
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.840
Yeah, so, 400 million years ago,
21
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.890
when this enzyme evolved,
22
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.940
there wasn't very much oxygen in the air.
23
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.470
All right, so I'm the little Rubisco enzyme,
24
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.440
and, like, on the conveyor belt here,
25
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.570
and, okay, carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide,
26
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.430
carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen,
27
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.900
and I don't notice I accidentally grabbed an oxygen
28
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.753
out of the box.
29
00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:08.520
(laughter)
30
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.770
And it produces compounds that are inhibitory
31
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.390
to photosynthesis, so it kinda starts to shut things down.
32
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.230
I mean, it's been going on for billions of years,
33
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.230
and nobody's cared.
34
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.063
Yeah, well-
35
00:01:17.063 --> 00:01:18.240
I mean, it all basically works.
36
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.730
Photosynthesis right now is sort of a victim
37
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.810
of its own success.
38
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.970
Rubisco certainly is.
39
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.170
So by oxygenating the atmosphere via photosynthesis,
40
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.500
you now have a huge amount of oxygen in the atmosphere,
41
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.664
but you need a carbon dioxide to make the reaction work.
42
00:01:33.664 --> 00:01:35.490
(alarm sounding)
43
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.073
So, what happens when Rubisco screws up?
44
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.740
The result gets shipped out
45
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.701
through a couple other parts of the cell,
46
00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:49.630
to where the mess is taken apart and recycled.
47
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.713
All of which consumes a lot of energy.
48
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.780
If you could fix this inefficiency problem,
49
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.810
the plant might make more soybeans, corn,
50
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.644
whatever it is?
51
00:02:00.644 --> 00:02:01.477
That's exactly it.
52
00:02:01.477 --> 00:02:02.940
Then they will have that energy to put towards
53
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.130
something that we would consider useful,
54
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.670
like making more food for us to eat.
55
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.480
Is this just a crazy theory, or is there some indication
56
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.590
that this could actually work?
57
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.520
There's quite a bit of evidence that this is working.
58
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.390
So right now we have this tested in a couple
59
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.240
of model species.
