Welcome to the Wonderful World of Photosynthesis.

Let's start by exploring why it's important. Choose bubble 1 to learn about the key role it plays in all life on Earth. Without it, you and I wouldn't even be here!

OK, now that you know how important photosynthesis is, it's time to find out how it works.

Start by watching the video for a quick overview, then play our game to see what's really happening at the molecular level.

Photosynthesis happens a little differently depending on the plant, and it's a lot more complex than what you see here.

To keep it simple, we're just going to focus on the overall reaction, and ignore all the in-between steps.
play

7
Your first job is to identify the reactants—the main ingredients—and the end products.

8
The arrow in the middle shows the direction of the reaction, which needs energy—in this case, in the form of light—to get started.

Match the chemical formula for each molecule with its common name by dragging each into the correct box under the common name. If a box turns red, try again with another formula.

10
Excellent! Those are the correct chemical formulas. Now it's time to make sure we have the right amounts of each by balancing the equation.
stop
.
11
Using the fewest molecules possible, balance the total number of atoms on the reactants side with the atoms on the products side.
play
.
12
Why does the number of each have to be the same?
play
.
13
Because in chemical reactions atoms are never destroyed, they're just rearranged—transformed from one combination into another.
play
.
14
Use the arrows to add or subtract each molecule.

15
As you do, notice how the total number of each atom above is determined by multiplying the coefficient
play
.
16
—the number of molecules—by the subscript—the little number below and to the right of each atom that says how many are in each molecule.
stop
.
17
You did it! You successfully balanced the reactants and products.
play
.
18
Now it's time to visualize the reaction symbolized by this formula of letters and numbers. You'll do it by breaking the reactant molecules apart and then putting them back together as the products.
stop
.
19
First let's add the number of each of the reactants you selected into the bin.
stop
.
20
Now add energy to start the reaction. Push the arrow button to add more energy until the molecules break apart.

21
Nice! To help you out, we're now pausing the action and organizing the elements into neat little piles of atoms

22
—something that doesn't—I repeat, does not—really happen in nature. But hey, this is a game.
play
.
23
Drag each atom into the correct mold for the molecules that make up the products for the reaction. You'll know the arrangement is right when the bonds light up.

24
Glucose is complicated, but here's a hint: Carbon atoms form the backbone of most organic molecules, so try placing those before adding the oxygen and hydrogen atoms.
stop
.
25
Excellent! You've turned six carbon dioxide and six water molecules into one glucose and six oxygen molecules.

Consider yourself a master of the overall reaction behind the process of photosynthesis.

27
OK, now that you know why photosynthesis matters and how it works, it's time to explore the future of this essential reaction.

The future, you ask? How can a reaction have a future?

Well, as amazing as photosynthesis is, scientists think we need to make it a lot better if we want to feed our growing population.

Rubisco is pretty amazing, but it messes up all the time. Boy, I can relate.

Choose bubble number 5 to learn how.

Select bubble number 6 to see how scientists are trying to give Rubisco a boost—and what it could mean for our future.
