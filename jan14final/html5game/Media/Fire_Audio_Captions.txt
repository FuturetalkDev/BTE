Fire. We humans have had a long and close relationship with this natural phenomenon. It cooks our food and keeps us warm. On the downside, it can wipe out forests and destroy neighborhoods.

But what is fire, really? What are you looking at when you stare into one? Select bubble 1 to find out.

Now that you know the basics—that fire is a chemical process—let's dig a little deeper.

There are lots of different reactions happening in fire, depending on the fuel and other factors. But we're going to focus on two of the main ones.

7
Your first job is to identify the reactants—the main ingredient—and the end products.

8
The arrow in the middle shows the direction of the reaction, which needs energy—in this case, in the form of heat—to get started.

9
Match the chemical formula for each molecule with its common name by dragging each into the correct box under the common name. If a box turns red, try again with another formula.

10
Great! Those are the correct chemical formulas. Now it's time to make sure we have the right amounts of each molecule by balancing the equations.
stop
.
11
Using the fewest molecules possible, balance the total number of atoms on the reactants side with the atoms on the product side.
play
.
12
Why does the number of each have to be the same?
play
.
13
Because in chemical reactions atoms are never destroyed, they're just rearranged—transformed from one combination into another.

14
Use the arrows to add or subtract each molecule.

15
As you do, notice how the total number of each atom above is determined by multiplying the coefficient

16
—the number of molecules—by the subscript—the little number below and to the right of each atom that says how many atoms are in each molecule.

.
17
You did it! You successfully balanced the reactants and the product.

18
Now it's time to visualize the reaction symbolized by this formula of letters and numbers. You'll do it by breaking the reactant molecules apart and then putting them back together as the products.
stop
.
19
First let's add the number of each of the reactants you selected into the bin.

Now add energy to start the reaction. Push the arrow button to add more energy until the molecules break apart.

Nice! To help you out, we're now pausing the action and organizing the elements into neat little piles of atoms

—something that doesn't—I repeat, does not—really happen in nature. But hey, this is a game.

23
Drag each atom into the correct mold for the molecules that make up the products for the reaction. You'll know the arrangement is right when the bonds light up.

Excellent! You've combined carbon and oxygen to form carbon dioxide, and hydrogen and oxygen to form water.

Like you saw in the video, another product of this reaction, not shown here, is heat and light.

Energy is released in reactions like these when the molecules of the reactants store more chemical energy than the products.
