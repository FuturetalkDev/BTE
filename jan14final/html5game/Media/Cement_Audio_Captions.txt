But you can't have concrete without cement to hold it together. Select bubble 1 to understand the difference.

Now that you know what cement is and why it's important, let's find out how they make it.

The central reaction for making cement is pretty simple.

Your first job is to identify the reactant—the main ingredient—and the end products.

The arrow in the middle shows the direction of the reaction, which needs energy—in this case, in the form of heat—to get started.

Match the chemical formula for each molecule with its common name by dragging each into the correct box under the common name. If a box turns red, try again with another formula.

Excellent! Those are the correct chemical formulas. Now it's time to make sure we have the right amounts of each by balancing the equation.

12
Using the fewest possible molecules, balance the total number of atoms on the reactant side with the atoms on the products side.

.
13
Why does the number of each have to be the same?

14
Because in chemical reactions atoms are never destroyed, they're just rearranged—transformed from one combination into another.

Use the arrows to add or subtract each molecule.

As you do, notice how the total number of each atom above is determined by multiplying the coefficient

—the number of molecules—by the subscript—the little number below and to the right of each atom that says how many atoms are in each molecule.

Nicely done! You successfully balanced the reactant and the products.

Now it's time to visualize the reaction symbolized by this formula of letters and numbers. You'll do it by breaking the reactant molecule apart and then putting it back together as the products.

First let's add the reactant into the bin.

Now add energy to start the reaction. Push the arrow button to add more energy until the molecules break apart.

Nice! To help you out, we're now pausing the action and organizing the elements into neat little piles of atoms

Drag each atom into the correct mold for the molecules that make up the products for the reaction. You'll know the arrangement is right when the bonds light up.
